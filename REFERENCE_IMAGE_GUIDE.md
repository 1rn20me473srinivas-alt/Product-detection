## PowerShell Download Script Template

After finding images on Pexels, copy the download URLs and use this script:

```powershell
# Navigate to project
Push-Location C:\workspace\edge-insights-demo

# Backup current references
if (!(Test-Path "references_old")) {
    Copy-Item -Recurse references references_old
    Write-Host "✅ Backed up to references_old/"
}

# Download function
function Download-Image {
    param($url, $path)
    try {
        Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $path -UseBasicParsing
        Write-Host "✅ Downloaded: $path"
    } catch {
        Write-Host "❌ Failed: $path - $($_.Exception.Message)"
    }
}

# === PRODUCT 1: Dark Chocolate Bar ===
$p1_urls = @(
    "PASTE_PEXELS_DOWNLOAD_URL_HERE",  # p1_angle_0.jpg
    "PASTE_PEXELS_DOWNLOAD_URL_HERE",  # p1_angle_30.jpg
    "PASTE_PEXELS_DOWNLOAD_URL_HERE",  # p1_angle_60.jpg
    "PASTE_PEXELS_DOWNLOAD_URL_HERE",  # p1_angle_90.jpg
    "PASTE_PEXELS_DOWNLOAD_URL_HERE",  # p1_angle_120.jpg
    "PASTE_PEXELS_DOWNLOAD_URL_HERE",  # p1_angle_150.jpg
    "PASTE_PEXELS_DOWNLOAD_URL_HERE",  # p1_angle_180.jpg
    "PASTE_PEXELS_DOWNLOAD_URL_HERE"   # p1_angle_210.jpg
)
$angles = @(0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210)
for ($i=0; $i -lt 8; $i++) {
    Download-Image -url $p1_urls[$i] -path "references/p1/p1_angle_$($angles[$i]).jpg"
}

# === PRODUCT 2: Yoga Mat ===
# (Repeat pattern for p2 through p11)

Write-Host "`n🎉 Download complete! Check references/ folder"
```

## How to Get Pexels Download URLs

## Quick Manual Alternative

If you prefer manual download:

1. Create folders if needed:
```powershell
Push-Location C:\workspace\edge-insights-demo\references
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6,p7,p8,p9,p10,p11
```

2. Download 8 images per product from Pexels
3. Rename them to: `p[X]_angle_[Y].jpg` where:
   - X = product number (1-11)
   - Y = angle (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210)

4. Place in correct folder: `references/p1/`, `references/p2/`, etc.

---

## Verification

After downloading all images:

```powershell
Push-Location C:\workspace\edge-insights-demo\references
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File | Group-Object DirectoryName | Select-Object Name, Count
```

Should show 8 images per folder (p1 through p11).

## Next Steps

1. Download images using guide above
2. Restart server: Server already running with improved algorithm
3. Test detection with new references
4. Check console for top-3 candidate scores
5. Verify semantic features are detected correctly

**The algorithm fixes are already applied and running. Better references will further improve accuracy!**
